# Project 3: Spots

by Connor Ward

## Descrtiption

A website that allows users to share images along with a title. It also allows them to customize their profile and like posts.

The website requires using a grid to organize images depending on the users screen size. Other elements such as the username, description, and post titles have to scale as well. Overflowing text ends in ellipses. Hover states are used in button elements to show the users interaction.
